# 2048 Game

This project is a Python-based implementation of the popular game 2048. The game is built using the Pygame library and provides a simple and interactive user interface to play the game.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need Python 3.x and pip installed on your system. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you're using a newer version of Python, Pip is already installed.

### Installing

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adepeju4/2048.git
```

Navigate into the cloned repository:

```bash
cd 2048-game
```

Running the game
After the successful installation of all the requirements, you can start the game by running:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Game Instructions

Use the arrow keys to move the tiles.
Tiles with the same number merge into one when they touch.
The game is won when a tile with the number 2048 appears on the board.
The game is lost when the board is full and no valid move is left.
